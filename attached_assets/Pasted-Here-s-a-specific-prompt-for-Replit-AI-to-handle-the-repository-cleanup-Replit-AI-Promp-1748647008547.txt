Here's a specific prompt for Replit AI to handle the repository cleanup:

---

**Replit AI Prompt:**

```
I need to clean up my Git repository because it's too large for GitHub. Please help me:

1. UPDATE .GITIGNORE FILE:
Create or update the .gitignore file in the root directory with these entries:
```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
package-lock.json

# Audio uploads - user-generated content
uploads/
*.mp3
*.wav
*.m4a

# Generated files
generated-icon.png
attached_assets/

# Environment files
.env
.env.local

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

2. REMOVE LARGE FILES FROM GIT TRACKING:
Run these git commands to remove the large files from version control but keep them locally:
- git rm -r --cached uploads/ (if it exists)
- git rm -r --cached attached_assets/ (if it exists)
- git rm --cached package-lock.json (if it exists)
- git rm --cached generated-icon.png (if it exists)

3. COMMIT THE CHANGES:
- git add .gitignore
- git commit -m "Clean up repository: update .gitignore and remove large files"

4. ENSURE UPLOADS DIRECTORY WORKS:
Make sure my server.js file has code to create the uploads directory if it doesn't exist:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const uploadDir = './uploads';
if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
}
```

Please execute these steps in order and let me know if any commands fail or need adjustment. This is for a Frank O'Hara poetry project where users upload audio recordings.
```

**Alternative Shorter Prompt (if the above is too long):**

```
Help me clean up my Git repo - it's too big for GitHub. Please:

1. Update .gitignore to exclude: uploads/, attached_assets/, package-lock.json, generated-icon.png, *.mp3, *.wav, *.m4a, node_modules/, .env files

2. Remove these large files from Git tracking (but keep locally): uploads/, attached_assets/, package-lock.json, generated-icon.png

3. Commit changes with message "Clean up repository and update .gitignore"

4. Make sure server.js creates uploads/ directory if missing

This is for an audio upload poetry website. Execute the git commands and file updates for me.
```

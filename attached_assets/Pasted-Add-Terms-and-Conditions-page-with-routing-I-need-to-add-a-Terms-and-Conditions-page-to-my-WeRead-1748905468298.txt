Add Terms and Conditions page with routing

I need to add a Terms and Conditions page to my WeRead Frank O'Hara project. Here's what I need:

1. **Create a new route** `/terms` that displays the full Terms and Conditions
2. **Update the upload form** to make "terms and conditions" a clickable link that opens the T&C page
3. **Style the T&C page** to match the existing site design (clean, readable, mobile-friendly)

**Implementation details:**
- The T&C page should open in a new tab/window when clicked from the form
- Keep the existing checkbox functionality - users still need to check "I agree"
- Make the T&C page easy to read with proper headings, spacing, and typography
- Ensure it's mobile-responsive like the rest of the site

**The complete Terms and Conditions text to use:**
